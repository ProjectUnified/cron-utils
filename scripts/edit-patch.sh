# Enter edit mode for one existing patch: rebuild the module trees from
# .upstream + overlays, `quilt push` up to AND INCLUDING the target (later
# patches stay deferred; quilt tracks the stack in .pc/, no state file).
# The target stays applied so edits refine it: regenerating from a reverted
# tree would silently drop the patch's own hunks.
# Refuses only on a PARTIAL stack (a session in progress). A fully-pushed or
# clean tree is rebuilt deterministically; uncommitted new-patch work on such
# a tree is wiped, so commit new patches first.
# Usage: bash scripts/edit-patch.sh <patch-file>  (basename, with or without
# the patches/ prefix). Never modifies patches/ itself.
# NB: quilt push exit codes are unreliable (2 on noop); completion is judged
# by the post-condition (`quilt top` == target), not the exit code.
